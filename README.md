# What are we doing here?

This repository is going to be used to organize common and reusable indexes for 
data collection from blockchain and web3 organizations. 

It was largely inspired by Electric Capital's ecosystem 
[index](https://github.com/electric-capital/crypto-ecosystems). We want to test
and see if the open source community surrounding web3 would be interested in helping
contribute and maintain an active index of growth in the space. 

# How to use this Repository

This repository will contain RFC documents that will graduate to Proposals to launch
data organization projects. We will follow the [RFC_TEMPLATE.md](./RFC_TEMPLATE.md) to submit proposals
and work together to form a consensus around moving forward together. 

# Motivations

This is largely an experiment to find out if web3 and crypto contributors are interested
in helping cross collaborate with a goal of bettering the entire universe surrounding blockchain.
