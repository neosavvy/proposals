# RFC Template // Propose your project

Provide a brief two sentence overview. This is just a suggestion and could require more subsections.

## Background

Set some context for what you are proposing and why you think it needs to exist. 

## Proposal

Explain what you are going to do here, if it's net new try to explain how you will accomplish your goals.

### Architecture

If necessary give some high level architectural impacts. Examples could include any of the following
1. User Experience
2. Infrastructure and Engineering
3. Data Organization and Acquisition
4. Cloud deployment 

### Costs

If there are anticipated costs we will need a proposed mechanism to overcome them. For now this is all 
open source and is not funded so proposals on acquiring funds to support open source could be needed.


### Stakeholders

Explain who is required and willing to help with this initiative. Where possible include contact information 
in the event a future maintainer wants to propose changes or get involved. The future success of open source
will be beholden to how easy it is to include more maintainers and contributors.
